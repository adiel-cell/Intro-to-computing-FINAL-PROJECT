                <h2 style="text-align: left;">About Me:</h2>
<p2 style="text-align: left;"> I've stayed in University of Perpetual Help Molino for about 1 year turning 2 years now, i've always wanted to become
    a IT  student even before Senior Highschool as that is what the lord is telling me. For the longest time computer studies 
    has always been that one subject that is hard for me to do because it requires me to memories a lot of codes but after further realisation.
    I don't think that's the case because i know some IT developers, web designers and even coding masters have moments where they too have to struggle.
    Where exactly do i know this? Simple its on the internet LMAO. I am 19 years old now, born in June 17 2005 my father is a nurse and so is my mother
    I have two siblings a little brother and sister and i am the eldest amongst them. </p2>
<br></br>
    <p3 style="text-align: left;"> Anyways i have no experience when it comes to coding or anything related to technology but i've always been using it all my life and i want to immerse
    myself even further and become a top IT student or at least get the grasp of it.  My expectations aren't high for myself but i do have the little confidence in myself 
    so i too can learn all kinds of coding and pray to the lord i get the top scores in whatever the task that the professor throws at me. I am no push over and i will fight
    for my dreams and earn TONS of cash when i work for a big tech company like microsoft or any game development studio.
